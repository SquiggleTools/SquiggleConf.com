			SquiggleConf is a community-oriented local conference run by
			<a href="/about">Squiggle.Tools</a>, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Our
			mission is to promote developer education and bring as wide a range of
			people as possible into expert developer tooling circles. We don't have
			any major corporate backing and pay for expenses out of our organizers'
			personal budgets. We also believe in being open and transparent so others
			can see what running a conference like ours entails.

			SquiggleConf 2024 operated at a net loss of approximately $9,050:

			We knew coming into SquiggleConf 2024 that conferences are expensive and
			that most -especially first editions- almost always lose money. It's worth
			it to us because we love the conference, love the people around it, and
			believe we're making a positive impact on the web development tooling
			community. ðŸ’™

	<CommonContent heading="Expenses">
		<BodyText>
			SquiggleConf 2024 incurred total expenses of approximately $57,350:
		</BodyText>
		<BodyList as="ol">
			<li>Hotel accommodations: $15,750</li>
			<li>Venue rentals: $12,000</li>
			<li>Catering: $7,100</li>
			<li>Transportation: $4,750</li>
			<li>Marketing and promotions: $4,000</li>
			<li>Speaker experience: $4,000</li>
			<li>Post-conference event: $3,000</li>
			<li>Photography: $2,750</li>
			<li>On-site branding and rentals: $2,000</li>
			<li>Merchandise: $2,000</li>
		</BodyList>
		<BodyText>
			This was the smallest set of expenses we felt we could reasonably commit
			to without drastically worsening the first edition of the conference. For
			example, we saved an estimated $5,000 by only catering light breakfast and
			snacks: attendees were given walking guides to the local Faneuil Hall
			Marketplace for lunch. Selling t-shirts separately from tickets instead of
			including them the way many conferences do saved us another $2,000 or so.
			<br /><br />
			We were also fortunate to be able to reduce costs by performing much of the
			expensive A/V setup ourselves. The quotes we received from local vendors were
			all well over $20,000 (some double, and one triple that). We instead used our
			own equipment and staff, driven over from Michigan TypeScript.
			<br /><br />
			Still, tech conferences are <em>expensive</em>. Flying speakers in from
			around the country and boarding them in a hotel for several nights comes
			out to an average cost of more than $2,000 per non-local speaker. Renting
			a venue for a day is also costly, especially factoring being locked into
			on-site catering.

	<CommonContent heading="Revenue">
		<BodyText>
			SquiggleConf 2024 brought in total revenue of approximately $48,300:
		</BodyText>
		<BodyList as="ol">
			<li>Tickets: $26,100</li>
			<li>Sponsorships: $22,000</li>
			<li>Merchandise: $200</li>
		</BodyList>
		<BodyText>
			Traditional conference wisdom suggests you should plan your budget around
			the expected income from ticket sales, then use sponsorships as a safety
			net. Post-COVID-lockdown conferences like us find it difficult to make
			that happen. We've heard from others that expecting roughly a third of
			revenue to come from sponsorships is common.
			<br /><br />
			Ticket sale revenue was somewhat evenly split between regular tickets and those
			with early bird or other discount codes:
		</BodyText>
		<BodyList as="ol">
			<li>Regular: $13,950</li>
			<li>Early bird: $3,100</li>
			<li>Other discounts: $9,050</li>
		</BodyList>
		<BodyText>
			Roughly 70% of tickets came through the last month before the conference.
			That was terrifying. Other conference organizers warned us about this too,
			but that only partially alleviated our worry during the earlier months.

	<CommonContent heading="Closing Thoughts">
		<BodyText>
			We're expecting that future iterations of SquiggleConf will be slightly
			less expensive per day. Some purchased items can be used year-over-year
			and we've also learned which costs can be avoided if needed. We project
			that SquiggleConf 2025, which will be 2 days instead of 1, will total
			roughly $100,000-$110,000 in expenses.
			<br /><br />
			We also believe we'll be better positioned to make up money as we grow the
			conference organizing team and gain credibility from past successful events.
			We hope to bring on team members who can specialize in particularly valuable
			tasks such as corporate sponsorships and ticket sales.
			<br /><br />
			Our goal is to stabilize the conference organizing flow in 2025, break even
			in 2026, and start to make back our money in 2027 onwards. We're committed
			to running at least 2025 and 2026 iterations of SquiggleConf.
